      <h3>New York City Outreach</h3>
      <p>
        It has been a great few months for Cross Country Evangelism. We have traveled to the Northeast, the Midwest, and
        the Southeast with the gospel. We participated with ATL's Voice in NYC for the week of September 11th. Jason
        Cantrell has been inviting evangelists to open air preach with him around the city for the week culminating with
        a gospel outreach at Ground Zero. We heralded the truth and interacted with many people throughout the city, on
        the subway, the Staten Island Ferry, Battery Park, Time Square, Union Square, and Washington Square Park. We even
        spent a day preaching at the infamous Planned Parenthood in Manhattan on Bleeker Street which is now permanently
        closed. Going to the Big Apple gives the opportunity to share the gospel with people from all over the world who
        are always willing to stop and dialogue.
      </p>

      <h3>Massachusetts Campus Outreach</h3>
      <p>
        The last week of October we teamed with some saints in Massachusetts to labor at a few college campuses; Salem
        State University, the University of Connecticut, and UMass Lowell. Overall, the students at the schools in
        Massachusetts were quite beside themselves, yet it is to be expected at those two institutions. At Salem State
        we were greeted with a rough LGBTQ reception with some of the students spouting tolerance yet showing their
        intolerance towards the gospel message. The students at UMass Lowell provided a very similar reception with one
        student throwing milk on one of the preachers and was quickly arrested for disorderly behavior and another
        student stole a sign and was apprehended by the police shortly afterwards as well. There was even an article in
        the school paper about the outreach that day. Despite the foolishness and folly, the Good News still went
        forward to the many students and facility at the institutions for the glory of King Jesus. By God's grace the
        Christian students on those campuses were very encouraged we came to take a stand for Christ, and some were
        compelled to share the gospel with their classmates while we were there and they engaged us with questions about
        being better at evangelism, they received and provided prayer and shared their testimonies. We finished our time
        in the state with an outreach on the streets of Salem, MA on Halloween. People come from all over the world for
        the holiday celebration and it affords a great opportunity to proclaim the gospel to tens of thousands of people,
        young and old in the center of the city well into the evening.
      </p>

      <h3>Ohio Ministry Stops</h3>
      <p>
        We visited with the saints in Ohio at LaRue Baptist Church, Providence Church, and Redeemer Covenant Church. We
        were able to do ministry at Cleveland State University with pastors Austin Hetsler and Ralph Hull and gave away
        many gospel tracts and preached the gospel to throngs of people in the thousands and gave away hundreds of tracts
        before the Ohio State University football game against the team from Rutgers with our dear brother Michael
        Coughlin.
      </p>

      <h3>Virginia in December</h3>
      <p>
        The first weekend in December we traveled to Hampton, VA to meet with Don "Stonewall" Karns and present the Good
        News at the Dominion Energy Christmas Parade in Richmond, VA. It is a great venue; the people are attentive and
        mostly take the tracts and some even applaud when the preaching is done. Later in the afternoon we took the
        gospel to Colonial Williamsburg where the street and sidewalks are filled with many families and shoppers who
        come for the Grand Illumination Fireworks. It is a great opportunity to give witness of the Lord Jesus Christ
        during the Christmas Season.
      </p>

      <h3>Prayer and Travel Notes</h3>
      <p>
        In Salem, Mike has had an ongoing interaction over the years with a transvestite whom he has been trying to win
        to Christ. He seems like hard ground, however Mike continues to pray for his salvation. This year in direct
        answer to prayer the Lord enabled a little bit longer of a conversation between them than the two have had in the
        past. In October Robert traveled to London with Sports Fans Outreach International for gospel preaching
        throughout the city of London during the week and for two NFL football games at massive venues. He also labored
        with Phil Close and Jimmy Hamilton in their respective "fishing holes" in the Birmingham and Nottingham area in
        the UK. In November Mike attended the Men's Summit Meeting with Christ The Rock Church in Ohio and was edified by
        the messages and fellowship that went on there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, we travel to Jamacia with a small team for our sixteenth trip to the island. Please keep us in prayer as
        we go the herald the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ!
      </p>
